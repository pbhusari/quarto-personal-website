## Street Tree Monitoring Network (STEM)
*May 2021 – Summer 2024* · [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/stemm-network)

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## 🏆 1st Place — Microsoft Azure IoT Hack for Sustainability (Global)
Built a deployment-ready demo in 48 hours. Endorsed by San José city arborists and backed by peer-reviewed urban forestry research.

Urban forests are critical infrastructure — but newly-planted street trees have up to **30% annual mortality**, largely from inadequate watering during the first few years of establishment. STEM is a city-scale IoT sensor network that gives urban foresters real-time soil moisture visibility across every monitored tree, turning reactive tree care into data-driven stewardship.

What started as a hackathon project became a real deployment. After winning globally, I took STEM from prototype to a working local network — securing **Microsoft for Startups** backing and **$10,000** from the City of Boulder, Colorado to fund the first sensor rollout. I continued developing the system as a **Purdue directed project**, spending the summer of 2024 on the hardware side: designing and building out a **LoRaWAN gateway** and conducting a rigorous **embedded system power study** to validate the 5-year battery life target for field-deployed sensor nodes.

Each node is a capacitive moisture sensor paired with an ESP32 microcontroller, potted in vandalism-resistant PVC housing for underground installation. Readings stream over MQTT → LoRaWAN gateway → Azure IoT Hub → Stream Analytics → SQL Server, surfaced through an ASP.NET Core dashboard with Azure Maps and Charts.js for geospatial and historical views.
